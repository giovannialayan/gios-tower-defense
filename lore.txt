notes:
- call the enemies scourge
- call mana er = Elemental Resource

premise:
- the player is a powerful wizard that defied the high council and was sentenced to clean up the ancient elemental labyrinth that is infested with element scourge

backstory:
- the world is filled with wizards and different factions of wizards with different specialties.
- one such faction is the elemental clan of wizards which obviously manipulate the power of elements.
- the elemental labyrinth used to be the worst punishment the high council could sentence one to in the elemental clan.
- but then they realized they have the fucking power of elements and could do way worse stuff than make someone solve a puzzle.
- it has been centuries since anyone has stepped inside and is now infested with elemental scourge that have been eating the elemental power, called er, of the labyrinth.

story:
- the player is prodigious member of the elemental clan of wizards
- the player shows promise in being able to wield multiple elements at once.
- usually members of the clan specialize in one element, being able to maintain a second element takes years of training.
- the player is also a very mischievous member and is always causing trouble in the clan.
- the player just totally pranked an orphanage by setting it on fire and striking it with lightning.
- the high council, tired of the player's bullshit, sentenced them to rid the elemental labyrinth of the elemental scourge.
- the player is now tasked with cleaning up this eternal pest problem.
