damaging towers base dps = 1
support towers base dps = .5

attack speed tower (default lightning)
- base atk = 1
- base atkspd = 1
- base range = 5
- mod atk = .1
- mod atkspd = .5
- mod range = 1

burst tower (default fire)
- base atk = 5
- base atkspd = 5
- base range = 5
- mod atk = 2
- mod atkspd = .9
- mod range = 1

artillery tower (default whimsical)
- base atk = 2
- base atkspd = 3
- base range = 10
- mod atk = 1
- mod atkspd = .7
- mod range = 3
- can target up to range / 3 enemies every time it shoots, firing a shot at each enemy
- (dps = 1 when attacking 2 enemies)

pulse tower (default order)
- base atk = 2
- base atkspd = 2
- base range = 5
- mod atk = .5
- mod atkspd = .7
- mod range = .5
- attack is a pulse that hits all enemies in range, disperses atk evenly between all enemies

crowd control tower (default nature)
- base atk = 1.5
- base atkspd = 3
- base range = 5
- mod atk = .25
- mod atkspd = .8
- mod range = 1
- every three attacks stuns the enemy hit for atk/3 seconds

slow tower (default earth)
- base atk = 1
- base atkspd = 2
- base range = 5
- mod atk = .5
- mod atkspd = .8
- mod range = 1
- attack slows enemy hit by enemy.spd * ((1 / enemy.maxhp) * (enemy.maxhp - atk)) for 2 seconds
- y - y1 = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) * (x1 - x)
- y1 = modMin , y2 = modMax , x1 = bigMin , x2 = bigMax , x = input
- note that max slow occurs when the enemy is one shot, when attack = max health, so i dont have to worry about attack > max health because the enemy will be dead

shred tower (default chaos):
- base atk = 0
- base atkspd = 0
- base range = 0
- mod atk = 0
- mod atkspd = 0
- mod range = 1
- gives adjacent towers (enemy max health * .1) on their attack and their attack stat is reduced to attack * .1

amplifier tower (default water)
- base atk = 0
- base atkspd = 0
- base range = 3
- mod atk = 0
- mod atkspd = 0
- mod range = 1
- gives towers in range extra atk, atkspd, and range equal to target.atk *= 1.1 and target.atkspd *= .9 and target.range *= 1.1
- gives towers in range this element in addition to their own

enemy classes

all expressions in enemy classes are multiplied by (waveNum + floor(waveNum / 10) * 5)
speed does not change with wave num
spawn interval will always be low enough to spawn all enemies in 30 seconds

cur
- quantity = 2
- health = 2
- attack = 1.5
- speed = 1.05
- worth = 2
- ability: blank
- flavor text: the most basic form of elemental scourge, it is completely unevolved and not specialized for any particular situation

knight

- health = 5
- attack = 3
- speed = .52
- worth = 10

- health = .5
- attack = .5
- speed = 1.58
- worth = 1
- ability: small and fast, there are a lot of them.

paladin
- quantity = / 1.5
- health = 3
- attack = 1.5
- speed = 1.05
- worth = 3.5
- ability: after being hit 3 times the paladin will gain a shield that blocks all damage for 5 seconds and increase their speed to 1.15.

- flavor text: a scourge that has the ability to transpose er that damages it into an immense amount of power and speed.
- ability in depth:
- 100% missing health = 3 speed
- 100% missing health = 10 attack
- percent missing health = (-x / maxhealth)
- speed = basespeed + (-currenthealth / maxhealth + 1)
- attack = baseattack + ((maxhealth * waveNum - x * (waveNum + 1)) / maxhealth)

challenges and rewards

order implemented
- title: Balance
    - hit 10 enemies with a single order pulse 
        -> order towers will deal their full damage to all enemies hit by an order pulse
    code: in pulse check if it hit 10 enemies

lightning implemented
- title: shock therapy
    - have 10 lightning bullets from a single tower targeting the same enemy 
        -> instead of firing bullets the lightning tower uses lightning strikes that have no travel time and deal a portion of the damage dealt to nearby enemies
    code: on an enemy check if it has 10 children that are bullets all from the same tower and are lightning

whimsical implemented
- title: Unimaginable Speed
    - have a whimsical tower whose range covers every tile on the map 
        -> whimsical bullets accelerate toward their target and deal more damage based on their final speed
    code: check tower position every time range increases and see if radius is greater than the distance between position and edges

nature implemented
- title: Overgrowth
    - kill an enemy where it doesnt move from the first time it is stunned 
        -> when an enemy is stunned by a nature bullet vines will grow on surrounding tiles causing enemies that pass over them to be slowed
    code: in an enemy check if its position changes after each hit and if it stays the same until death

earth implemented
- title: Earth Shaker
    - have 10 enemies be slowed by earth tower bullets at the same time
        -> the earth tower periodically creates earthquakes that slow all enemies within its range and the slow effect on earth bullets stacks
    code: save wave number and quantity in wave in challenge manager then every time an enemy is slowed check if it is in the wave and add all unique enemies slowed to the check until they all die or are all slowed

chaos implemented
- title: Entropy
    - kill an enemy with a tower enhanced by a chaos tower where the killing bullet wouldnt have killed without the chaos tower 10 times 
        -> double the range and make it a square
    code: in enemy check if health is > 0 before chaos effect and < 0 after then increment counter in challenge manager

fire implemented
- title: Conflagration
    - kill a tank with a single fire bullet 
        -> when an enemy is killed by a fire bullet it explodes dealing damage to nearby enemies
    code: in enemy check if it is a tank, check if that was the first time it was hit, check if it was a fire bullet, check if it died

water implemented
- title: Flooding
    - have a water tower whose stat increases are equivalent to the next upgrade for all stats of the enhanced tower 
        -> increase the stat enhancements to 20%
    code: in tower check if attack - attack / 1.1 >= attackMod ; attackspeed < attackspeedMod / (x+2) ; range - range / 1.1 >= rangeMod

skill points (primordial orbs)
- skill points are awarded every 10 waves
- the number of skill points the player recieves is equal to waveNum / 10 so they get 1 upon completing wave 10, 2 on completing wave 20, etc
- primary skills base cost = 1
- secondary skills base cost = 2
- tertiary skills base cost = 3 

- multiplier is dumb and weird but i dont feel like deleting it from the doc
- primary skills multiplier = 2 or 1.5
- secondary skills multiplier = 2.5 or 2
- tertiary skills multiplier = 3 or 2.5

- increment skills by their base cost
- primary skills increment = 1
- secondary skills increment = 2
- tertiary skills increment = 3

skill point skill tree
- use the hyperbolic equation used for attack speed scaling or not ask players about it

-- money gain rate -> increase (default = .01, increment = .005)
    -- initial max money -> increase (default = 100, increment = 10)
        -- base tower cost -> decrease (default = 10, increment = -1) (cap at cost = 1)
        -- tower cost multiplier -> decrease (default = 2, increment = -.05) (cap at 1.25x, make it take at least 10 upgrades to get there)

-- base health at start -> increase (default = 10, increment = 1)
    -- base heal -> increase (default = 0, increment = 1) (make it start at 0, you only gain maxhealth without this skill no healing)
        -- max base health increase -> increase (default = 5, increment = 1)

-- enemy worth -> increase (default = 0, increment = 1)
    -- knights appear more often, take more damage (default = 0, increment = .05) (from all sources except chaos tower effect)
        -- armorers appear more often, take more damage when within half the range of a tower (default = 0, increment = .1)
        -- warlocks appear more often, their damage threshhold is lower (default = .25, increment = .01) (cap at .05)
    -- monks appear more often, they are slower (default = 1, increment = -.01) (cap at .5)
        -- assassins appear more often, their attack based on missing health is lower (default = 0, increment = -.01) (cap at .5)
        -- paladins appear more often, their shield lasts less (default = 5, increment = -.1) (cap at 2)
        -- succubi appear more often, their heal is less effective (default = .3, increment = -.01) (cap at .1)
* for all special enemies chance only inceases once by 5% - done

*all three are tier 3
-- tower attack upgrade cost multiplier -> decrease (default = 2, increment = -.05) (cap at 1.25x)
-- tower attack speed upgrade cost multiplier -> decrease (default = 2, increment = -.05) (cap at 1.25x)
-- tower range upgrade cost multiplier -> decrease (default = 2, increment = -.05) (cap at 1.25x)

misc ideas
- add something to the scourge-o-nomicon so that the player can change what wave number the values are shown as, default wave 1
