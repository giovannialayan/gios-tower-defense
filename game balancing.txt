damaging towers base dps = 1
support towers base dps = .5

attack speed tower (default lightning)
- base atk = 1
- base atkspd = 1
- base range = 5
- mod atk = .1
- mod atkspd = .5
- mod range = 1

burst tower (default fire)
- base atk = 5
- base atkspd = 5
- base range = 5
- mod atk = 2
- mod atkspd = .9
- mod range = 1

artillery tower (default whimsical)
- base atk = 2
- base atkspd = 3
- base range = 10
- mod atk = 1
- mod atkspd = .7
- mod range = 3
- can target up to range / 3 enemies every time it shoots, firing a shot at each enemy
- (dps = 1 when attacking 2 enemies)

pulse tower (default order)
- base atk = 2
- base atkspd = 2
- base range = 5
- mod atk = .5
- mod atkspd = .7
- mod range = .5
- attack is a pulse that hits all enemies in range, disperses atk evenly between all enemies

crowd control tower (default nature)
- base atk = 1.5
- base atkspd = 3
- base range = 5
- mod atk = .25
- mod atkspd = .8
- mod range = 1
- every three attacks stuns the enemy hit for atk/3 seconds

slow tower (default earth)
- base atk = 1
- base atkspd = 2
- base range = 5
- mod atk = .5
- mod atkspd = .8
- mod range = 1
- attack slows enemy hit by enemy.spd * ((1 / enemy.maxhp) * (enemy.maxhp - atk)) for 2 seconds
- y - y1 = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) * (x1 - x)
- y1 = modMin , y2 = modMax , x1 = bigMin , x2 = bigMax , x = input
- note that max slow occurs when the enemy is one shot, when attack = max health, so i dont have to worry about attack > max health because the enemy will be dead

shred tower (default chaos):
- base atk = 0
- base atkspd = 0
- base range = 0
- mod atk = 0
- mod atkspd = 0
- mod range = 1
- gives adjacent towers (enemy max health * .1) on their attack

amplifier tower (default water)
- base atk = 0
- base atkspd = 0
- base range = 3
- mod atk = 0
- mod atkspd = 0
- mod range = 1
- gives towers in range extra atk and atkspd equal to target.atk += target.atk * .1 and target.atkspd -= target.atkspd * .1
- gives towers in range this element in addition to their own
