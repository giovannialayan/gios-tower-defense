# gios-tower-defense

To run the game go to the "build" folder and run "simple tower defense.exe".

To look at the code go to "Assets/Scripts"

This is a tower defense game that has procedurally generates maps, it currently uses a simple algorithm for the procedural generation but I plan on increasing its complexity so it can generate more interesting maps. I used a binary tree method for procedurally generating mazes, I plan on experimenting with other algorithms such as Prim's and Kruskal's to make maps that are much more interesting and dont look very similar to eachother later on. Because the maps are mazes I used a breadth first search algorithm for enemy path finding.
